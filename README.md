For anyone looking at this in the future. 
This was my second rust project and was intended for learning rust on a bigger scale project. 
The scope of this project is big, with servers client, etc, generic ish apis for running EA of any types and such. 

As such there have been many things that i've called "bugs" of rust that really more of my not understanding of how rust work or getting annoying with not being able to express certain things that are easy enough in other languages. (mainly python as I come from python/ c++ background). 

As such there are branches called rustbug/X where usually the last commit on that branch is going to generate some compiling error where i tried to do something but couldn't figure it out.
